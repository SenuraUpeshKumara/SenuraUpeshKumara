### ðŸ‘‹ Hi guys ðŸ‘‹
###<b><i>Who am I ?</i></b>

###<font color="yellow">I'm a tech enthusiast who would like to explore new technologies, not just programming languages but also devices. I love to share knowledge with the rest of the world, and that's why I write a lot of articles, conduct courses, and make YouTube videos. Since I'm (still) a full-time Software Engineer, I also like to share my code so others can make use of them</font>
